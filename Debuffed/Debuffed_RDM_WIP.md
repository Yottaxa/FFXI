Yottaxa - Debuffed Edited for RDM: (WIP)
This is for addon version = '1.0.0.4'
Backup your existing debuffed folder.
Rename debuffed.lua to debuffed.old
Paste in the new debuffed. 
You have to edit the lua to make this work for your setup.
Using notepad++ or some other editor, start at line 100 and read the comments.
Edit the various paramiters as indicated.
The array at ~ line 138 is the big part, where you have to know your sets for each spell.
Sounds assume a C:/windower/addons/debuffed path. IF thats not correct you have to edit lines 413-432. 
If you do not want the sounds, comment line 406 or just dont install the sounds folder.
